# Nalu PopUpController example using Domino-UI
this is a simple example that has three screens using [Domino-UI](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-ui).

The detail screen is displayed using a popup.

## Using
To run the examples:

* clone the repository

* run `mvn clean install` & `mvn gwt:devmode`

* copy the link and paste the link into the browser url

## Note
This example does not have a server implementation. It uses a mock service on the client side.

## Implementation
This example has one shell, no plugins, etc. It uses Domino-UI as the widget library. The detail screen uses the PopUpController implementation.

## NaluDominoSimpleApplication
Full featured example providing a shell with four areas:

1. application shell:
      * a header area
      * a footer area
      * a navigation area
      * a content area

The content area will be used to show the three different components:

* a search component
* a list component (the result from the search)
* a detail component (a selected person from the list) as PopUpController

**Attention:**
This example has a filter implemented, that, in case 'Bart Simpsons' is selected from the list, the application will route to the search view. This is the desired behavior: see [```BartSimpsonFilter```](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu-examples/blob/master/NaluDominoSimpleApplication/src/main/java/com/github/nalukit/example/nalu/simpleapplication/client/filters/BartSimpsonFilter.java)
