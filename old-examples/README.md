# Old Nalu examples
To help you to understand how the framework works, [Nalu](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu) comes with some examples.

To run the examples follow the instructions.

Please, keep in mind, Nalu is a client side framework, so most of the server calls are simulated on the client side or are mocked in these examples. Because of that, there is no need for a server side implementation. Also, Nalu does not force you to use a special widget lib. This is up to you. In this examples we use native Elemental 2, Elemento, [Domino-UI](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-ui) and native GWT widgets.

Most of the examples have three screens (search screen, result list and a detail screen).

## NaluDominoCachedApplication
This example demonstrates the caching feature. To see how the caching feature works, search for names containing a 'S' or 'D'. On the list screen, turn on caching, select a person and edit the data. Press save to get the changes saved. Once back on the list, you'll see, that the data is not updated (cause Nalu uses the cached screen). After pressing reload, you will see the updates.

## NaluDominoLoginApplication
This example demonstrates an easy way how to implement a login feature. Once the application gets started, you will see a login screen (you can enter any user and password). After the login you can navigate through the application cause the user is marked as logged in (inside the context). Press reload and you will not get to the bookmarked page. Instead, you will be redirected to the login screen because the context is new created and the information that the user i logged in gets lost. 

This examples has also an error page implemented. To see the error page, change something inside the hash. If this is an invalid route, the error page will appear. 

This example uses three different shells and the composite feature. (detail screen)

## NaluDominoLoginPluginApplication
This example works in the same way like the NaluDominoLoginApplication example, but uses a plugin for the login classes and error classes.

## NaluDominoSimpleApplication
This example uses Domino-UI to implement the components You can navigate between those screens, update data, etc. This example uses the Nalu-Plugin-Elemental2 and DominoUI as widget library. 

The Domino example is deployed on the mvp4g server. The deployed version can be found [here](http://www.mvp4g.org/NaluDominoSimpleApplication-1.0.0/index.html).

## NaluElementoSimpleApplication
The Elemento example is similar to the Domino example, except that it uses Elemento instead of Domino-UI as widget library. This example uses the Nalu-Plugin-Elemental2. 

## NaluGwtSimpleApplication
The native GWT example is similar to the Elemento example, except that it uses native GWT widgets. This example uses the Nalu-Plugin-GWT. 

## NaluGxtSimpleApplication
The GXT example is a mail box simulation using GXT 4.0 widgets. This example uses the Nalu-Plugin-GWT. 

## NaluMaterialSimpleApplication
This example uses the GWT Material widgets and uses the Nalu-Plugin-Elemental2. 

## Notes

Some things are nonsense and only implemented to show some features of Nalu.

For example: 
* If Bart Simpson is selected from the list, the application will route to the search view. This is the desired behavior: f. e.: see [BartSimpsonFilter-class](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu-examples/blob/master/NaluDominoSimpleApplication/src/main/java/com/github/nalukit/example/nalu/simpleapplication/client/filters/BartSimpsonFilter.java) for more informations.
