# Nalu examples
To help you to understand how the framework works, [Nalu](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu) comes with some examples.

To run the examples follow the instructions.

Please, keep in mind, Nalu is a client side framework, so most of the server calls are simulated on the client side or are mocked in these examples. Because of that, there is no need for a server side implementation. Also, Nalu does not force you to use a special widget lib. This is up to you. In this examples we use native Elemental 2, Elemento, [Domino-UI](https://github.com/DominoKit/domino-ui) and native GWT widgets.

Most of the examples have three screens (search screen, result list and a detail screen).

This example was use at the DEVK-Meetup 'GWT vs. vue.js - a show down' on 07/03/2019 to demonstrates the use of Nalu, domino-rest and domino-ui.
It's a multo module project using Domino-UI, Domino-Rest and Nalu.

The slides (German) of the meetup can be found [here](https://github.com/NaluKit/nalu-examples/tree/main/devkexample/etc/presentation).


## Nalu Complex App Example

This example should give you an impression how to set up a Nalu project and how to do things in Nalu.
It uses a lot of the Nalu features, shows Best Practice and can be use as base for your own complex application.
